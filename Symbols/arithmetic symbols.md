## Arithmetic Symbols

These are all the symbols used to in Arithmetic!

They are basically the foundations of math and they area used daily.

- $+$, plus sign: used for addition, to add one number to another. It is read "plus". For example, $3+2$. It is also used for denotating **positive** numbers, for example: $+2$.
  
- $−$, minus sign: used for subtraction, to remove one number to another. It is read "minus". For example, $3−2$ . It is also used for denotating **negative** numbers, for example: $-2$.

- $\pm$, plus-minus sign: used for addition or subtraction, to **add or to remove** one number to another. Is is read "plus minus". For example, $3 \pm 2$, which is equal to $5$ or $1$.

- $\mp$, minus-plus sign: pretty much the same as plus-minus sign, generally used in **conjunction with the plus-minus sign**, $x \pm y \mp z$. For example, $2 + 3 - 1$ or $2 - 3 + 1$, but not $2 - 3 - 1$.
  
- $×$, multiplication sign: used for multiplication, to multiply one number to another. It is read "times". For example, $3×2$. In algebra, you'll see $n x$ (where $n$ is any number), without the $⋅$ or the $×$, for example: $3x$.
  In linear algebra and geometry, it denotes the **cross-product** (or vector-product). In set theory, denotes the **cartesian-product** and the **direct-product**.
  
- $⋅$, dot sign: also used for multiplication. It is read "dot". For example, $3⋅2$. In linear algebra and geometry, it denotes the **dot-product**.
  
- $:$, colon sign: used in some countries as division, to divide two numbers equally. It is read "divided by" or "ratio" or "such that", depending on the context. For example, $6:3$ . It also denotes the **ratio** of two quantities.
  In set notation, it means "such that" and it is used to tell that a value **makes true another value**. For example, $\{ x : x \in \mathbb{N}, x < 10\}$, which means "x is a value such that x is in the Natural Number Set and it is less than 10".

- $/$, slash sign: used for division. It is read "divided by" or "over". For example, $6 / 3$.

- $\frac{n}{m}$, fraction sign: used for division. It is read "divided by" or "over". For example, $\frac {6}{3}$.

- $n \; mod \;m$, modulo sign: used for the modulo operation in modular arithmetic, to get the **remainder** of two values when they are divided. It is read "modulo". For example, $10 \; mod \;3$.

- $n^m$, power sign: used for exponentiation, which is **repeated multiplication**, where n is multiplied by itself m times. It is read "to the power of". For example,  $2^3$.

- $\sqrt[m]{n}$, radical or root sign: used for the root operation, which is the **inverse operation of the exponentiation**, where n is "rooted" by m times. It is read "root". For example, $\sqrt[3]{8}$.
  If m isn't written, it simply means "square root", which is $m = 2$, for example $\sqrt {4} = 2$, because $2^2 = 4$.

- $\log_{m} n$, log sign: used for the logarithm operation, which gives the **exponent value**, where n is the exponentiation value and m is the base. It is read "log". For example, $\log_{10} 1000$. If m isn't written or it $\log$ is written $\ln$, it means logarithm with $m = e$, where $e$ is the Euler's Number. This is also called **natural logarithm**.

- $n!$, factorial sign: used for factorial, where n is **multiplied by its previous number** and by its previous previous number until it gets to 1. It is read "factorial". For example, $3!$.
