WE GO IN ECONOMICS AND PHYSICS WITH THIS ONE üó£Ô∏è‚Äãüî•

- $e$, Euler's number: used in Calculus, it's an Irrational Number which value is $e = 2.7182818284...$ or just $e \approx 2.718$. Found by Euler, it's a constant. Its formula is $e = \sum ^\infty_{n=0} \frac{1}{n!}$. It's very useful in economics, logarithms (that's why $ln$ was invented, which is logarithm with base equals to $e$), physics, finance etc... It always appears because it's connected with connected growth and decay calculations.

- $f(x)$, function: used in a lot of maths, it is an **relation between an original value (or operation) where it gets "transformed" into another value**. It is read "function of x". For example, $f(x) = 2x + 1$, which means that putting a whatever value into $x$, it gets transformed and becomes another value, like $x = 3$, so $f(3) = 2(3) + 1 = 7$. It gets **ONE AND ONLY ONE VALUE**. If in the operation there are more variables than the function, then it is not a function. For example, $f(x) = 2x + y$, then it's not a function, but if there was $f(x, y) = 2x + y$, then it was a function with two variables. It is possible to use other letters, like $g(x), h(x)...$. In graphics and analysis, it is possible to find $y = f(x)$, which means "the y axis is equal to the function of x".

- $\to$, to: used in functions, it is used to **declare a function**. For example, $A \to B$, which means "from A to B". It is possible to find also $f : A \to B$. Basically, has the same meaning of $y = f(x)$.

- $\mapsto$, maps to: used in functions, it is used to **declare a function where a particular element is mapped**. For example, $x \mapsto x^2$, which means "x is mapped to x squared", so if $x = 2$, then $x^2 = 4$. It is useful to declare functions without having to name it.

- $lim_{a \to n}$, limit: used in Calculus, it means **what happens when $a$ is approaching $n$.** It is read "limit of". For example, 
  $lim_{x \to 0} f(x) = \frac{2x + 1}{x} = \frac{2(1) + 1}{1} = 2 + 1 = 3$, 
  $lim_{x \to 0} f(x) = \frac{2x + 1}{x} = \frac{2(0.5) + 1}{0.5} = \frac{2}{0.5} = 4$, 
  $lim_{x \to 0} f(x) = \frac{2x + 1}{x} = \frac{2(0.01) + 1}{0.01} = \frac{1.02}{0.01} = 102$,
  $lim_{x \to 0} f(x) = \frac{2x + 1}{x} = \frac{2(0.001) + 1}{0.001} = \frac{1.002}{0.001} = 1002$,
  $lim_{x \to 0} f(x) = \frac{2x + 1}{x} = \frac{2(0.00001) + 1}{0.0001} = \frac{1.0002}{0.0001} = 10002$,
  ...
  $lim_{x \to 0} f(x) = \frac{2x + 1}{x} = \frac{2(0) + 1}{0} = \frac{1}{0} = \infty$.

- $'$, Lagrange's notation: used in Calculus, it is used to take the derivative, to **see the rate of change when $f(x)$ is plugged in**. It is read "derivative of f of x" or simply "f prime". In math notation, $f'(x) = lim_{h\to0} \frac{f(x + h) - f(x)}{h}$. For example, $f(x) = 2x + 1$, so $f'(x) = lim_{h\to0} \frac{2(x + h) + 1 - (2x + 1)}{h} = \frac{2x + 2h + 1 - 2x - 1}{h} = \frac{0x + 2h - 0}{h} = \frac{2h}{h} = 2$. When there are two or more $'$, it means derivative of the derivative of the derivative of...

- $\frac{dy}{dx}$, Leibniz's notation: used in Calculus, it is used to take the derivative, to **see the rate of change when $f(x)$ is plugged in**. It is read "derivative of f of x" or simply "f prime". The $d$ stands for derivative. It is used in various way, like if $y$ depends on $x$, then it is said "d y over d x", if $f$ is a function, then $\frac{df}{dx}$.
<br>

- $\int$, integrals: used in Calculus, it is used to **see the area under the curve of the function**. It is read "integral". In math notation, $\int^b_a f(x) dx$, where $\int$ stands for "sum" (note that it looks like an S stretched), $a$ and $b$ are numbers, $f(x)$ is the function, $dx$ is the anti-derivative, which is the reciprocal of the original derivative. For example, $\int^2_0 2x+1 \ dx = \int 2x \ dx + \int 1 \ dx = x^2 + \int 1dx = x^2 + x = (2^2 + 2) - (0^2 + 0) = 6$. When $a$ and $b$ are present, it is a definite integral, whereas they are absent, it is a indefinite integral. For example, $\int 2x+1 \ dx = \int 2x \ dx + \int 1 \ dx = 2 \int x \ dx + \int 1 \ dx = 2(\frac{x^2}{2}) + x + C = x^2 + x + C$, where $C$ is the integral constant.
