These are symbols to use to denote an equality or similarity between some values.

- $=$, equal sign: used for equality, to tell that two or more values are equal, **the same thing**. It is read "equal", "is equal to", "be equal to". For example, $2 = 2$.
  It can also be used **to create a mathematical object**. Example, let $a = 0$, which is read "let a equal zero", or "let a be equal to zero".
<br>

- $\ne$, not-equal sign: used for inequality, to tell that two or more values are NOT equal, **not the same thing**. It is read "not equal". For example, $2 \ne 3$.
<br>

- $\approx$, approximate sign: used for approximation, to tell that one value is almost equal or around the true value, **closer to the true value**. For example, $\pi \approx 3.14$. _That's because $\pi$ is an irrational number and we cannot write all the infinite decimal numbers, so for let us simplify operations, we just put this sign and approximate it.
<br>_

- $\sim$, tilde sign: used for equivalence, to tell an equivalence relation between two values or **proportionality**. It is read "tilde". For example, $x \sim y$. It is also used in probability and statistics to denote the **probability distribution of a random variable**. 
<br>

- $\equiv$, triple-bar sign: used for equivalence, to denote an identity, where an equality is **always true no matter what value gets the variables**. It is read "equivalent" or "congruent". For example, $(a + b)^2 \equiv a^2 + 2ab + b^2$. It also used in Number Theory, more specifically in **modular arithmetic.**
<br>

- $\cong$, congruence sign: used for congruence in geometry between two shapes. May also denotes an **isomorphism**. It is read "congruent" or "is isomorphic to". For example, $A \cong B$.
 <br>

- $\propto$, proportional sign: abbreviation for "is proportional to". For example, $A \propto B$.
<br>

- $:=$, definition sign: used for definition, to define a rule "by definition" or a **mathematical object**. For example, let $a := 0$.
