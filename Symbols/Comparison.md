These are symbols to compare two values.

- $>$, greater-than sign: used to compare, to tell if **a is bigger than b**. It is read "greater than, bigger than". For example, $3 > 2$.
<br>
  
- $<$, less-than sign: used to compare, to tell if **a is smaller than b**. It is read "less than, smaller than". For example $3 < 4$.
<br>
  
- $\ge$, greater-or-equal sign: used to compare, to tell if **a is bigger OR equal to b**. It is read "greater or equal" or "bigger or equal". For example, $3 \ge 3$ or $3 \ge 2$.
<br>
  
- $\le$, less-or-equal sign: used to compare, to tell if **a is smaller OR equal to b**. It is read "less or equal", "smaller or equal". For example, $3 \le 3$ or $3 \le 4$.
<br>
  
- $\gg$, much-greater-than sign: similiar to the greater-than sign, expect that this is used to tell when **a is muuuch bigger than b**, despite the fact that "much" isn't actually defined in math. It is read "much greater than" or "much bigger than". For example, $999 \gg 1$.
<br>
  
- $\ll$, much-less-than sign: similiar to the less-than sign, expect that this is used to tell when **a is muuuch smaller than b**, despite the fact that "much" isn't actually defined in math. It is read "much less than" or "much smaller than". For example, $1 \ll 3789$.
