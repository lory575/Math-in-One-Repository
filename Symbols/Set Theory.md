These are symbols used in the Set Theory. Might be hard to read, so tell me if it is readable.

- $A, B, C...,$ sets letters: used to indicate sets, which are "containers" that **contains values**. It is read as the letter followed by "set". For example, $a \in B$. Basically, $a$ (which is a number) is in the $B$ set. It can be **initialized as** $A = \\{a, b, c...\\}$. For example, $A = \\{1, 2, 3...\\}$. Basically, $A$ is a set that contains $1, 2, 3...$.
<br>
  
- $\emptyset$, empty-set sign: used to indicate an empty set, which is a set that **contains nothing**. It is read "empty set". For example, $a \notin \emptyset$. It can also **be written as** $\\{\\}$.
<br>
  
- $\\#$, number sign: used to indicate the cardinality of a set, which is **how many numbers (or values) there are in the set**. It is read "cardinality". For example, $A = \\{4, 6, 8\\}$, so $\\#A = 3$. It can also **be written with** $|A|$, like $|A| = 3$.
<br>
  
- $\in$, is-in sign: used to indicate if a number **is in a set**. It is read "is in" or "belongs to" or "is a member of". For example, $a \in B$.
<br>
  
- $\notin$, not-in sign: used to indicate if a number **is NOT in the set**. It is read "is not in" or "does not belong to" or "is not a member of". For example, $a \notin B$.
<br>
  
- $\subset$, subset sign: used to indicate if a set **is a proper subset of another set**. It is read "subset". For example, $A = \\{1, 2, 3\\}$ and $B = \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\\}$, then $A \subset B$. Since $B$ **contains all the elements of** $A$, then $A$ is a subset of $B$.
<br>
  
- $\subseteq$, subset-or-equal sign: used to indicate if a set **is a subset or equal of another set**. It is read "subset or equal" or simply "subset" (thus it makes a bit misunderstanding). For example, $A = \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\\}$ and $B = \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\\}$, then $A \subseteq B$. Since $B$ **contains some (or all) the elements of** $A$, then $A$ is a subset or equal to $B$.
<br>
  
- $\supset$, supset sign: used to indicate if a set **is a proper superset of another set**. It is read "supset" or "superset". For example, $A = \\{1, 2, 3\\}$ and $B = \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\\}$, then $B \supset A$. Since $A$ **contains some of the elements of** $B$, then $B$ is a superset of $A$.
<br>
  
- $\supseteq$, supset-or-equal sign: used to indicate if a set **is a superset or equal of another set**. It is read "supset or equal" or simply "supset" (thus it makes a bit misunderstanding). For example, $A = \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\\}$ and $B = \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\\}$, then $B \supseteq A$. Since $A$ **contains some (or all) of the elements of** $B$, then $B$ is a subset or equal to $A$.
<br>
  
- $\cup$, union sign: used to indicate an **union between two sets**. It is read "union" or "united". For example, $A = \\{1, 2, 3\\}$ and $B = \\{3, 4\\}$, then $A \cup B = \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$.
<br>
  
- $\cap$, intersection sign: used to indicate an **intersection between two sets**. It is read "intersection" or "intersecate". For example, $A = \\{1, 2, 3\\}$ and $B = \\{3, 4\\}$, then $A \cap B = \\{3\\}$.
<br>
  
- $\backslash$, difference sign: used to indicate a **difference between two sets**. It is read "difference". For example, $A = \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\\}$ and $B = \\{1, 2, 3\\}$, then $A \backslash B = \\{4, 5\\}$. Basically it gets all the **elements that are in the $A$ set, but NOT in the $B$ set**. It can also be written with the $-$, like $A - B = \\{4, 5\\}$.
<br>
  
- $\triangle$, symmetric-difference sign: used to indicate a **symmetrical difference between two sets**. It is read "symmetric difference". For example, $A = \\{1, 2, 3, 5\\}$ and $B = \\{1, 2, 5, 6, 7\\}$, then $A \triangle B = \\{3, 6, 7\\}$. Basically it gets all the **elements that are in the $A$ set but NOT in the $B$ set AND the elements that are in the $B$ set but NOT in the $A$ set**. Written in math notation, $A \triangle B = \\{A \backslash B\\} \cup \\{B \backslash A\\}$. It can also be written with the $\ominus$, like $A \ominus B = \\{3, 6, 7\\}$.
