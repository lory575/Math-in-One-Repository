Greeks went crazy with this one. These are words used in trigonometry. Trigonometry also stands for "triangle measurements". It is used widely in math. It is also used for finding angles or sides in a triangle.

- $\pi$, pi sign: used widely in most of applied math, which is an **Irrational Number which value is $\pi = 3.141592654...$ or just $\pi \approx 3.14$**. It is also a constant, since **whatever circle's circumference divided by its diameter will always be equal to $3.14...$**. Written in math notation, $\pi = \frac{C}{d}$, where $C$ is the circumference and $d$ is the diameter. It is read "pi".

- $\alpha, \beta, \theta...$, Greek letters: used in trigonometry, they are letters of the Greek alphabet, where trigonometry born. **It defines an angle variable**.

- $°$, degree: used in trigonometry, **it defines an angle**. It is read "degree". For example, $90°$. Also, notice that $180°= \pi$.

- $rad$, radians: used in trigonometry, **it defines a radian**. It is read "radian". For example, $1 \ rad \approx 57.295779513°$. Notice that $rad = \frac{180}{\pi}°$.

- $sin(\theta)$, sine function: used in trigonometry, it is a **function where it's equal to the ratio of the opposite side of the interested angle to the hypotenuse (we're talking about rectangular triangles).** Written in math notation,  $sin(\theta) = \frac{opposite}{hypotenuse}$. It is read "sine function". For example, if a rectangle triangle has the $opposite = 16$ and $hypotenuse = 25$, then $sin(\theta) = \frac{16}{25} = 0.64 \ rad$. It is possible to convert radians in degrees, $0.64 * \frac{180}{\pi} \approx 36.6692988888°$. So $0.64 \ rad$ and $36.6692988888°$ are the same thing, so are $sin(0.64 \ rad)$ and $sin(36.6692988888°)$.
