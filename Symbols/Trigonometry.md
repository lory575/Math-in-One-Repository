Greeks went crazy with this one. These are words used in trigonometry. Trigonometry also stands for "triangle measurements". It is used widely in math. It is also used for finding angles or sides in a triangle.

- $\pi$, pi sign: used widely in most of applied math, it is an **Irrational Number which value is $\pi = 3.141592654...$ or just $\pi \approx 3.14$**. It is also a constant, since **whatever circle's circumference divided by its diameter will always be equal to $3.14...$**. Written in math notation, $\pi = \frac{C}{d}$, where $C$ is the circumference and $d$ is the diameter. It is read "pi".

- $\alpha, \beta, \theta...$, Greek letters: used in trigonometry, they are letters of the Greek alphabet, where trigonometry born. **It defines an angle variable**.

- $°$, degree: used in trigonometry, **it defines an angle measurement**. It is read "degree". For example, $90°$. Also, notice that $180°= \pi$.
<br>

- $rad$, radians: used in trigonometry, **it defines a radian measurement**. It is read "radian". For example, $1 \ rad \approx 57.295779513°$. Notice that $rad = \frac{180}{\pi}°$.

- $sin(\theta)$, sine function: used in Trigonometry, it is a **function where it's equal to the ratio of the opposite side of the interested angle to the hypotenuse (we're talking about rectangular triangles).** Written in math notation,  $sin(\theta) = \frac{opposite}{hypotenuse}$. It is read "sine function". For example, if a rectangle triangle has the $opposite = 16cm$ and $hypotenuse = 25cm$, then $sin(\theta) = \frac{16}{25} = 0.64rad$. It is possible to convert radians in degrees, $0.64 * \frac{180}{\pi} \approx 36.6692988888°$. So $0.64rad$ and $36.6692988888°$ are the same thing, so are $sin(0.64rad)$ and $sin(36.6692988888°)$. It is useful for finding missing angles or sides, height and distance, waves...  I suggest to also look at **law of sine**.

- $cos(\theta)$, co-sine function: used in Trigonometry, it is a function where **it's equal to the ratio of the adjacent side of the interested angle to the hypotenuse**. Written in math notation, $cos(\theta) = \frac{adjacent}{hypotenuse}$. It is read "cosine function". For example, if a rectangle triangle has the $adjacent = 10cm$ and $hypotenuse = 25cm$, then $cos(\theta) = \frac{10}{25} = 0.4rad$. It is possible to convert radians in degrees, $0.4 * \frac{180}{\pi} \approx 22.918311805°$. So $0.4rad$ and $22.918311805°$ are the same thing, so are $cos(0.4rad)$ and $cos(22.918311805°)$. It is useful for finding missing angles or sides, height and distance, waves... I also suggest to look at **law of cosine**.

- $tan(\theta)$, tangent function: used in Trigonometry, **it's equal to the ratio of the opposite side of the interested angle to the adjacent**. Written in math notation, $tan(\theta) = \frac{opposite}{adjacent}$. It is read "tangent function". For example, if a rectangle triangle has the $opposite = 16cm$ and $adjacent = 10cm$, then $tan(\theta) = \frac{16}{10} = 1.6rad$. It is possible to convert radians in degrees, $1.6 * \frac{180}{\pi} \approx 91.673247221°$. So $1.6rad$ and $91.673247221°$ are the same thing, so are $tan(1.6rad)$ and $tan(91.673247221°)$. It is useful for finding missing angles or sides, height and distance, waves... I also suggest to look at **law of tangent**.

- $csc(\theta)$, co-secant function: used in Trigonometry, it's the **reciprocal of the sine function**, so it's the ratio of the hypotenuse of the interested angle to the opposite. Written in math notation, $csc(\theta) = \frac{hypotenuse}{opposite}$. It is read "cosecant function". For example, if a rectangle triangle has the $hypotenuse = 25cm$ and $opposite = 16cm$, then $csc(\theta) = \frac{25}{16} = 1.5625rad$. It is possible to convert radians in degrees, $1.5625 * \frac{180}{\pi} \approx 89.524655489°$. So $1.5625rad$ and $89.524655489°$ are the same thing, so are $csc(1.5625rad)$ and $csc(89.524655489°)$. It is useful for finding missing angles or sides, height and distance, waves...
<br>

- $sec(\theta)$, secant function: used in Trigonometry, it's the **reciprocal of the co-sine function**, so it's the ratio of the hypotenuse of the interested angle to the adjacent. Written in math notation, $sec(\theta) = \frac{hypotenuse}{adjacent}$. It is read "secant function".
<br>

- $cot(\theta)$, co-tangent function: used in Trigonometry, it's the **reciprocal of the tangent function**, so... guess what. It is read "cotangent function".
