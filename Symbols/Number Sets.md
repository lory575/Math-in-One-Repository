There are symbols to tell the Number Sets, which are sets where the numbers have precise properties. (fun fact, these are written in blackboard bold). They are all infinite.

- $\mathbb{N}$, Natural Set: used to indicate the Natural Number Set, to tell a set which **all the numbers are naturals**. It is read "natural set" or simply "natural". Examples, $x \in \mathbb{N}$, $3 \in \mathbb{N}$, $-1 \notin \mathbb{N}$.
  In this set there are all the **Positive Integer Numbers**, such as 
  $1, 2, 3...$
  It is countably infinite.
<br>

- $\mathbb{N_0}$, Natural Set with Zero: it's basically the Natural Set, but with the $0$ included:
  $0, 1, 2, 3...$
  It is countably infinite.
<br>

- $\mathbb {Z}$, Integer Set: used to indicate the Integer Number Set, to tell a set which **all the numbers are integers**. It is read "integer set" or simply "integer" (fun fact, it is written "Z" because it stands for "zahlen" in german, which means "numbers"). Examples, $x \in \mathbb {Z}$, $3 \in \mathbb {Z}$, $-1 \in \mathbb {Z}$, $\frac {1}{2} \notin \mathbb {Z}$.
  In this set there are all the **Positive and Negative Integer Numbers**, such as $...-3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3...$
  It is countably infinite.

- $\mathbb {Q}$, Rational Set: used to indicate the Rational Number Set, to tell a set which **all the numbers are rationals**. It is read "rational set" or simply "rational". Examples, $x \in \mathbb{Q}$, $3 \in \mathbb{Q}$, $-1 \in \mathbb{Q}$, $\frac {1}{2} \in \mathbb{Q}$, $\sqrt {2} \notin \mathbb{Q}$.
  In this set there are all the **Natural, Integer and Rational Numbers**, such as $... -3, -\frac{2}{3}, -1, 0, 1, \frac{1}{2}, 2, 3...$
  It is countably infinite.
 <br>
  
- $\mathbb {R}$, Real Set: used to indicate the Real Number Set, to tell a set which **all the numbers are real**. It is read "real set" or simply "real" (despite the fact there are irrational numbers...). Examples, $x \in \mathbb{R}$, $3 \in \mathbb{R}$, $-1 \in \mathbb{R}$, $\frac {1}{2} \in \mathbb{R}$, $\sqrt {2} \in \mathbb{R}$, $i \notin \mathbb {R}$.
  In this set there are all the **Natural, Integer, Rational and Irrational Numbers**, such as
  $... -3, -\frac{2}{3}, -1, 0, 1, \frac{1}{2}, \sqrt{2}, \sqrt{3}, 2,e, 3, \pi...$
  It is uncountably infinite.
<br>
  
- $\mathbb {C}$, Complex Set: used to indicate the Complex Number Set, to tell a set which **all the numbers are complex**. It is read "complex set" or simply "complex". Examples, $x \in \mathbb{C}$, $3 \in \mathbb{C}$, $-1 \in \mathbb{C}$, $\frac {1}{2} \in \mathbb{C}$, $\sqrt {2} \in \mathbb{C}$, $i \in \mathbb {C}$.
  In this set there are all the **Natural, Integer, Rational, Irrational and Complex Numbers**, such as
  $...-3, -\frac{2}{3}, i, -1, 0, 1, \frac{1}{2}, \sqrt{2}, \sqrt{3}, 2,e, 3, \pi...$
  Remember that $i = \sqrt{-1}$.
  It is uncountably infinite.
