These are all the symbols used to in Arithmetic!

They are basically the foundations of math and they area used daily.



- $+$, plus sign: used for addition, to add one number to another. It is read "plus". For example, $3 + 2$. It is also used for denotating **positive** numbers, for example: +2.
- $-$, minus sign: used for subtraction, to remove one number to another. It is read "minus". For example, $3 - 2$. It is also used for denotating **negative** numbers, for example: -2.
- $\times$, multiplication sign: used for multiplication, to multiply one number to another. It is read "times". For example, $3 \times 2$. In algebra, you'll see $nx$, without the $\cdot$ or the $\times$. That also means multiplication. For example, $3x$. In linear algebra and geometry, it denotes the cross-product (or vector-product). In set theory, denotes the cartesian-product and the direct-product.
- $\cdot$, dot sign: also used for multiplication, similiarly like $\times$. It is read "dot". For example, $3 \cdot 2$. In linear algebra and geometry, it denotes the dot-product.
- $:$, colon sign: used in some countries as division, to divide two numbers equally. It is read "divided by" or "ratio", depending on the context. For example, $6 : 3$. It also denotes the ratio of two quantities.
