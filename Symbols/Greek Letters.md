Since most of the mathematics uses Greek Letters, I think it's a good idea to write all the letters and its meaning.

- $\Delta$, uppercase delta: used in Physics, it means change or difference. It is read "delta". For example, $\Delta v = \frac{\Delta s}{\Delta t}$. In Algebra, it defines the discriminant, so $\Delta = b^2 - 4ac$. In Set Theory, it defines the symmetric difference between two sets, so $A \Delta B$.

- $\Omega$, uppercase omega: used in Physics, it defines electrical resistance. It is read "omega".
<br>

- $\Sigma$, uppercase sigma: used in Algebra, it defines summation. It is read "sigma".
<br>

- $\Pi$, uppercase pi: used in Algebra, it defines product. It is read "pi".
<br>

- $\Phi$, uppercase phi: used in Algebra, it defines the Golden Ratio and angles. It is read "phi".
<br>

- $\Gamma$, uppercase gamma: used in Physics, it defines the Gamma Function. It is read "gamma".
<br>

- $\Psi$, uppercase psi: used in Physics, it defines the Wave Function. It is read "psi".
<br>

- $\alpha$, alpha: used in Trigonometry, it defines angles and coefficients. It is read "alpha".
<br>

- $\beta$, beta: used in Trigonometry, it defines angles and coefficients. It is read "beta".
<br>

- $\gamma$, lowercase gamma: same use as $\Gamma$. It is read "gamma".
<br>

- $\delta$, lowercase delta: used in a variety of math, it defines small changes. It is read "delta".
<br>

- $\epsilon$, epsilon: used in Calculus, it defines a veeery small value in limits. It is read "epsilon".
<br>

- $\zeta$, zeta: used in Calculus, it defines the Zeta Function. It is read "zeta".
<br>

- $\eta$, eta: used in a variety of math, it defines efficiency or elasticity of a certain function. It is read "eta".
<br>

- $\theta$, theta: used in Trigonometry, it defines angles and parameters. It is read "theta".
<br>

- $\lambda$, lambda: used in Linear Algebra, it defines eigenvalues. It is read "lambda". For example, $Ax = \lambda x$. In Physics, it defines wavelengths.
