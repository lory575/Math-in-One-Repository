These are symbols used pretty much everywhere in math notation and in basic logic.

- $p, q, r...$, letters: used in logic, which are **propositions**. They are read as the letters. For example, $p =$  I am human, $q =$  All humans eat. It's basically a **simpler way to express propositions** and to not rewrite the same thing over and over.
<br>

- $\lnot$, not sign: used in logic, which means "not". It is read "not". For example, if $p =$  I am human, then $\lnot p =$ I am NOT human. It gets the **opposite of the original value**. If $q =$ TRUE, then $\lnot q =$ FALSE.
<br>

- $\lor$, or sign: used in logic, which means "or". It is read "or". For example, if $p =$ I am human, $q$ = I am an hamster, then $p \lor q$ = I am human **OR** I am an hamster. In the truth table, it gives **TRUE if at least one of the values is true**.
<br>

- $\land$, and sign: used in logic, which means "and". It is read "and". For example, if $p =$ I am human, $q =$ I have hands, then $p \land q =$ I am human **AND** I have hands. In the truth table, it gives **TRUE if both of the values are true**.
<br>

- $\implies$, implies sign: used in logic, which means "implies", "then". It is read "implies", "then". For example, if $p =$ I am human, $q =$ I eat, then $p \implies q =$I am human **IF** I eat. In the truth table, it gives **FALSE if the first proposition is TRUE and the second proposition is FALSE**. If $p =$ TRUE, $q =$ FALSE, then $p \implies q =$ FALSE. Instead, if $p =$ TRUE, $q =$ TRUE, then $p \implies q =$ TRUE. It might be a bit misunderstanding at first.
<br>

- $\iff$, if and only if: used in logic, which means "double implies". It is read "if and only if". For example, if $p =$ I am human, $q =$ I eat, then $p \iff q =$ I am human **IF AND ONLY IF** I eat. In the truth table, it gives **TRUE if both propositions have the same values**. If $p =$ TRUE, $q =$ TRUE, then $p \iff q =$ TRUE. If $p =$ FALSE, $q =$ TRUE, then $p \iff q =$ FALSE.
<br>

- $T$, tee sign: used in logic, which means "always true". It is read "tee" or "always true". I don't have examples right now...
<br>

- $\perp$, up-tack sign: used in logic, which means "always false". It is read "always false". I don't have examples right now...
<br>

- $\forall$, for-all sign: used in math notation, which is a **universal quantification**. It is read "for all". For example, $\forall x \in \mathbb{N}$, which means **"for all x that is in the Natural Set"**.
<br>

- $\exists$, exists sign: used in math notation, which is an **existential quantification**. It is read "exists" or "there exists". For example, $\exists x \in \mathbb{N}$, which means **"it exists an x that is in the Natural Set"**.
<br>

- $\nexists$, not-exists sign: used in math notation, which is a **non-existential quantification**. It is read "not exists", "there not exists". For example, $\nexists x \in \mathbb{N}$, which means **"it does not exists an x that is in the Natural Set"**.
<br>

- $\therefore$, therefore sign: used in logic, which means that the **first proposition implies the second proposition**. It is read "therefore". For example, all humans eat, and Marco is human, $\therefore$ Marco eats.
<br>

- $\because$, because sign: used in logic, which means that the **first proposition is implied by the second one**. It is read "because" or "since". For example, Marco eats $\because$ Marco is human.
