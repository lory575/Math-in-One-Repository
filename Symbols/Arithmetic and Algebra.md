These are all the symbols used to in Arithmetic!
They are basically the foundations of math and they are used daily.

- $+$, plus sign: used for addition, to add one number to another. It is read "plus". For example, $3+2$. It is also used for denotating **positive** numbers, for example: $+2$.
<br>
  
- $−$, minus sign: used for subtraction, to remove one number to another. It is read "minus". For example, $3−2$ . It is also used for denotating **negative** numbers, for example: $-2$.
<br>

- $\pm$, plus-minus sign: used for addition or subtraction, to **add or to remove** one number to another. Is is read "plus minus". For example, $3 \pm 2$, which is equal to $5$ or $1$.
<br>

- $\mp$, minus-plus sign: pretty much the same as plus-minus sign, generally used in **conjunction with the plus-minus sign**, $x \pm y \mp z$. For example, $2 + 3 - 1$ or $2 - 3 + 1$, but not $2 - 3 - 1$.
<br>
  
- $×$, multiplication sign: used for multiplication, to multiply one number to another. It is read "times". For example, $3×2$. In algebra, you'll see $n x$ (where $n$ is any number), without the $⋅$ or the $×$, for example: $3x$.
  In linear algebra and geometry, it denotes the **cross-product** (or vector-product). In set theory, denotes the **cartesian-product** and the **direct-product**.
<br>
  
- $⋅$, dot sign: also used for multiplication. It is read "dot". For example, $3⋅2$. In linear algebra and geometry, it denotes the **dot-product**.
<br>

- $*$, asterisk sign: also used for multiplication. It is read "times". For example, $3 * 2$.
<br>

- $:$, colon sign: used in some countries as division, to divide two numbers equally. It is read "divided by" or "ratio" or "such that", depending on the context. For example, $6:3$ . It also denotes the **ratio** of two quantities.
  In set notation, it means "such that" and it is used to tell that a value **makes true another value**. For example, $\{ x : x \in \mathbb{N}, x < 10\}$, which means "x is a value such that x is in the Natural Number Set and it is less than 10".
<br>

- $/$, slash sign: used for division. It is read "divided by" or "over". For example, $6 / 3$.
<br>

- $\frac{n}{m}$, fraction sign: used for division. It is read "divided by" or "over". For example, $\frac {6}{3}$.
 <br>
 
 - $\\%$, percent sign: used for percentage, to **express a number as a fraction of $100$**, to **express a proportionate part of a total**. It is read "percent". For example, there's a discount on bread of $20\%$ of its original price, which was $1.50$€. What's its price now? The $20\\%$ of $1.50$, which is $\frac{1.50 * 20}{100} = 0.3$, so $1.50 - 0.30 = 1.20$. The bread now costs $1.20$€. It can be also calculated by making $20\\% = \frac{20}{100} = 0.2$, so $1.50 * 0.20 = 0.30$, so $1.50 - 0.30 = 1.20$. It's a subtraction because it's a discount, so we need to remove the percentage's value to the original price. Anyway, there are plenty of examples on how to use it.
 <br>
 
- $n \ mod \ m$, modulo sign: used for the modulo operation in modular arithmetic, to get the **remainder** of two values when they are divided. It is read "modulo". For example, $10 \ mod \ 3$.
<br>

- $n^m$, power sign: used for exponentiation, which is **repeated multiplication**, where n is multiplied by itself m times. It is read "to the power of". For example,  $2^3 = 2 * 2 * 2 = 8$. If  $m$ is a negative number, then $n$ becomes a fraction such as $n^{-m} = \frac{1}{n^m}$. For example, $2^{-3} = \frac{1}{2^3} = \frac{1}{8}$. If m is a fractional number, then $n$ becomes a radical such as $n^\frac{a}{b} = \sqrt[b]{n^a}$. For example, $8^\frac{2}{3} = \sqrt[3]{8^2} = 2^2 = 4$.
<br>

- $\sqrt[m]{n}$, radical or root sign: used for the root operation, which is the **inverse operation of the exponentiation**, where n is "rooted" by m times. It is read "root". For example, $\sqrt[3]{8}$.
  If m isn't written, it simply means "square root", which is $m = 2$, for example $\sqrt {4} = 2$, because $2^2 = 4$.
<br>

- $\log_{m} n$, log sign: used for the logarithm operation, which gives the **exponent value**, where n is the exponentiation value and m is the base. It is read "log". For example, $\log_{10} 1000$. If m isn't written or $\log$ is written $\ln$, it means logarithm with $m = e$, where $e$ is the Euler's Number. This is also called **natural logarithm**.
<br>

- $|n|$, absolute sign: used for many context, in this case it's for the absolute of a number. It is thought as the distance between a number to another. It is read "absolute". For example, $|3| = 3$, $|-3| = 3$. Any positive or negative number will become positive. Also, $|n| = \sqrt{n^2}$.
<br>

- $n!$, factorial sign: used for factorial, where n is **multiplied by its previous number** and by its previous previous number until it gets to 1. It is read "factorial". For example, $3! = 3 * 2 * 1 = 6$.
<br>

- $\sum_{i = a} ^ b  n$, summation sign: used for summation, where $i$ **stands for index and it indicates the start number, $b$ is the final number, $n$ is the operation**. It is read "summation". For example, $\sum_{i=1}  ^9 2 + i = (2 + 1) + (2 + 2) + (2 + 3) + (2 + 4) + (2 + 5) + (2 + 6) + (2 + 7) + (2 + 8) + (2 + 9) = 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 = 42$ It also denotes a series, which is an **infinite sum where b is infinite**.
  yes, sigma.
 <br>

- $\prod_{i = a} ^b n$, product sign: used for product, where $i$ **stands for index and it indicates the start number, $b$ is the final number, $n$ is the operation**. It is read "product". For example, $\prod_{i = 1} ^9 2 + i = (2 + 1)(2 + 2)(2 + 3)(2 + 4)(2 + 5)(2 + 6)(2 + 7)(2 + 8)(2 + 9) = 3 × 4 × 5 × 6 × 7 × 8 × 9 = 181440$
  It also denotes a series, which is an **infinite product where b is infinite**.
